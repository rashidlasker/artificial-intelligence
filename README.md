# Artificial Intelligence '14-'15
This master repo contains all the code I wrote for an AI class I took at TJHSST. The language was Python in a Linux environment. Its topics included graphs, heuristics, constraint solvers, game trees, genetic algorithms, learning, natural language, agents, and machine vision.
